                <h6>What do editors aim for?</h6>
                <p>Journal editors need quality research in science to publish which is of high interest to their readers. The high-quality manuscripts with simple writings build impact on the scientific community, which has chances of early acceptance for publication. Acceptance of a manuscript solely depends upon editor’s choice, and it is worth knowing their decisions.</p>
                <p>A description of advancements in the research, preparing a manuscript with potential matter and a good format, simple in language, clear in technical issues and by following ethical practices gives the editor the best possibility in accepting the manuscript.</p>
