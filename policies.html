                <h4 class="main-headings">Journal Policies</h4>
                <p>Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health regularly obtains recommendations on individual manuscripts from reviewers who are not a part of our journal’s editorial staff. </p>
                <p>The journal follows an open peer-review model aimed to improve precision, transparency, and comprehensiveness of published manuscripts and to give assistance to editors in making decisions which manuscripts to publish. </p>
                <p>The selection of Peer-reviewers is made based on their expertise, capability in providing their excellency and fair reviews. Peer-reviewers are encouraged to advise editors on what base manuscript must improve its current quality and its priority for publication. </p>
                <p>Journal obtains reviews for a manuscript from peers around the world, who are experts in the manuscripts content area and research methods concerning the field of study. Journal allots manuscripts to two external (not suggested by the authors) reviewers to maintain its high-quality review process. For their efforts in a fair review, reviewers are given credit in the form of points and are redeemable by their publications in our journal.</p>
                <p>Journal strictly follows publications which come under the scope of the concerned specialization and if not will be returned to the authors without any further review to save the valuable time of our editors and peer-reviewers. </p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Research involving humans</h5>
                <h6>Ethics approval</h6>
                <p>All studies involving humans (individuals, human data or material) must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval must have been obtained for all protocols from the authors’ institutions or other relevant ethics committees (Institutional Review Board, IRB) to ensure that they meet national and international guidelines. Details of this approval must be provided when submitting an article, including the institution, review board name, and permit number(s).</p>
                <p>Human studies categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, should include a justification of the choice of definitions and categories, including whether any rules of human categorization were required by the relevant funding agencies. Appropriate non-stigmatizing language should be used when describing different groups.</p>
                <p>Ethics approval must be obtained before the research is conducted; retrospective approval can usually not be obtained and it may not be possible to publish the study.</p>
                <h6>Patient privacy and informed consent for publication</h6>
                <p>As stated in the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors: “Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed without informed consent. Identifying information should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) give written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that the patient be shown the manuscript to be published. When informed consent has been obtained it should be indicated in the published article.”</p>
                <p>Consent to participate: For all studies involving human participants, including personal genomics studies, case reports, clinical trials, questionnaires, observations, etc, informed written consent to take part in the research must have been obtained, and this should be stated in the article in a section entitled ‘Consent’. You can use our consent form or your own institution’s form as you prefer. If only oral consent was obtained (rather than written), the reasons need to be explained, confirmation of IRB approval that oral consent was adequate must be provided, and a statement of how it was documented included in the Consent section.</p>
                <p>Consent for publication of identifiable data: For any articles that include information that could potentially identify an individual, please ensure that you have obtained written, informed consent from all patients or healthy participants (or their legal guardians for minors, or next of kin if the participant is deceased), confirming that the results can be published. This includes large clinical datasets with direct or indirect identifiers (see this article for information), specific details about individuals, images and so on. If this applies to your article, you also need to include an explicit statement, under a separate heading of the ‘Consent’ section (we suggest: ‘Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details and/or clinical images was obtained from the patient/parent/guardian/relative of the patient.’).</p>
                <p>Alternatively, if no consent for publication was required (e.g. The data have been anonymized), then this should be clearly stated and a note should be added, confirming that such alterations have not distorted scientific meaning.</p>
                <p>Signed consent forms should be made available to the ContROL editorial office if requested.</p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Research involving animals</h5>
                <p>Studies involving animals must have been conducted in line with the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments’ (ARRIVE) guidelines, developed by NC3Rs to improve standards of reporting, ensuring that the data from animal experiments can be fully scrutinized and utilized. The relevant information outlined in these guidelines should be included in the appropriate section of the article.</p>
                <p>Experiments involving vertebrates or regulated invertebrates must be carried out within the ethical guidelines provided by the authors’ institution and national or international regulations. Where applicable, a statement of ethics permission granted or animal licenses should be included. If animals were used, but ethical approval was not required, a clear statement should be included stating why this approval was unnecessary.</p>
                <p>In all cases, a statement should be made to confirm that all efforts were made to ameliorate any suffering of animals and details of how this was achieved should be provided.</p>
                <p>Authors should comply with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Research involving plants</h5>
                <p>Studies on plants must be carried out within the guidelines provided by the authors’ institution and national or international regulations. Where applicable, a statement of permissions granted or licenses should be included. Authors should comply with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Copyright & Licenses</h5>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-bottom:10px;" class="pl-5">

                </ul>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Permanency of content</h5>
                <p>All articles published in Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health receive a DOI and are permanently published. This applies regardless of the outcome of the peer review that follows after publication.</p>
                <p>Authors can revise, change and update their articles by publishing new versions, which add to the article’s history; however, the individual versions, once published, cannot be altered or withdrawn and are permanently available on the Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health website.</p>
                <p>Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health participates in the CrossMark scheme, a multi-publisher initiative that has developed a standard way for readers to locate the current version of an article. By applying the CrossMark policies, Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health is committed to maintaining the content it publishes and to alert readers to changes if and when they occur.</p>
                <p>Clicking on the CrossMark logo (at the top of each Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health article) will give you the current status of an article and direct you to the latest published version; it may also give you additional information such as new referee reports.</p>
                <p>To maintain the integrity and completeness of the scholarly record, the following policies will be applied when published content needs to be corrected; these policies take into account current best practice in the scholarly publishing and library communities.</p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Retraction</h5>
                <p>This action is reserved for articles that are seriously flawed and so the findings or conclusions cannot be relied upon. Articles may be retracted for several reasons, including:</p>
                <p>Honest errors reported by the authors, Research misconduct (data fabrication), Duplicate or overlapping publication, Fraudulent use of data, Clear plagiarism, Unethical research.</p>
                <p>For any retracted article, the reason for the retraction and who is instigating the retraction will be clearly stated in the Retraction notice. The retraction notice will be linked to the retracted article (which usually remains on the site) and the article will be marked as retracted (including the PDF).</p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Conflicts of Interest</h5>
                <p>A Journal of Infectious Diseases and Public Health publication, neither expects nor receives any financial gains which would affect the process of a specific publication. No company or manufacturing industry is made flexible in drawing their attention towards possible misconduct in maintaining publications of their interest. </p>
                <p>No payment by industries and third parties (like companies which sell drugs and finished products) for research or patents, no possible public announcements by medical educators & non-publishing companies, are encouraged in a publication process.</p>
                <p>Clinicians having competing interests financially in editing research that in turn provide them income, political & non-profit organizations, consultancies are made explicit and put a far from their influence in a particular publication. </p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Academic Honesty</h5>
                <p>Authors are encouraged to disclose any particular explanation or method suggested by a reviewer or editor for a correction is being biased in research conduct or having strong beliefs in their harsh judgments after their successful revision.</p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Unbiased conduct </h5>
                <p>Reviewers & editors in the same field should take efforts in finding faults with articles from competing individuals, which delay in publication and further makes authors submit their work to false or lesser journals. </p>
                <h5 class="sub-headings">Confidentiality</h5>
                <p>Manuscripts submitted to journals are privileged communications that are authors’ private, confidential property, and authors may be harmed by premature disclosure of any or all of a manuscript’s details. </p>
                <p>Confidentiality in terms of sharing information about research, paper, book</p>
                <p><strong>Peer-review:</strong> Editors are suggested to seek the opinion of a constructive reviewer for most of the research articles. Editors should decide under which context, the manuscript has been accepted for publication, supported by the reviewer’s advice.</p>
                <p>The International Society for Medical Publication Professionals provides good practice guidelines, which are aimed at ensuring that “clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies are published responsibly and ethically”.</p>
                <p>Reviewers and editors are also required to declare any competing interests in their reports, as our readers who contribute comments on the site.</p>
